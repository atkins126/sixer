# sixer

A hexagonal minesweeper game where each digit indicates the number of mines around the cell at the distance not more than two. Instead of the numbers 10, 11, 12... the "digits" A, B, C, ... are used. As a game it is still playable for me even now as a good time killer. The game process is neither obvious, nor extremely hard.

This is my old project on Delphi from student time, so the code is slapdash enough, sorry ... I am not sure that that I am able/want to fix all of this and/or rewrite the code. I just recompiled it using the modern Delphi 10.3 for a compatibility with Windows 7,8,10. After that the project was moved to Lazarus, so the binaries now are completely opensource.

The installation - just decompress the released file sixer.zip.
